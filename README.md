## Description
This project is a study guide for HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. The goal was to provide a simple and all-in-one guide. The project aims to provide an accessible and convenient platform for individuals to brush up on these skills and gain confidence in their web development abilities. This project solves the problem of not having a user-friendly and organized study resource for HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. It provides a structured guide that allows learners to review and practice these topics in an interactive way.

Throughout the development of this project, lessons I've learned include:

- Understanding HTML structure and the role of the head and body elements in web page creation.
- Applying CSS styles, including margins, padding, and basic styling techniques, to enhance the appearance and layout of web pages.
- Familiarizing with essential Git commands like git status and git checkout -b for branch management and version control.
- Gaining knowledge about JavaScript variables, control flow, and the use of functions for logical operations and data manipulation.
- Integrating CSS stylesheets and JavaScript code into an HTML file to create a complete web page with interactive functionality.
